  |   Jet Kave Adventure brings everything you love about 2.5D              |
  |   platformers. Enjoy the skill-based action, challenging boss fights,   |
  |   clever secrets and thrilling set-pieces in a game where the Stone     |
  |   Age and science fiction collide.                                      |

  |   Meet Kave, the jet-powered caveman. A has-been chief banished by      |
  |   his own tribe, he stumbles upon... a jetpack! The device turns him    |
  |   into the only prehistoric man who stands a chance against "the        |
  |   alien invader" - a rather unlikable guy from the sky who'll readily   |
  |   kick off a disastrous volcanic eruption just so he can repair his     |
  |   spaceship. So begins Kave's quest to save the whole island and        |
  |   prove his worth to the tribe.                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Who needs double jumps when you've got a jetpack?! This piece of      |
  |   extraterrestrial tech is a real game changer - both for Kave and      |
  |   the player. Master jet-fueled platforming and fly over pitfalls,      |
  |   smash through walls, knock out enemies, and manipulate objects as     |
  |   you halt the alien threat once and for all.                           |
